      <h1>Bio</h1>
      <p>I'm a mechanical engineer by training with a strong interest in business development and programming.  I am extremely thankful for the opportunities I have been given and continually look to expand my skill set.  </p>
      <p>Business has always been elusive and exotic to me, but I've always have had an interest. After living with a friend with an entrepreneurial spirit, I discovered a bit of the same in myself. Now I look for ways I can add value to others and learn more about myself along the way.</p>
